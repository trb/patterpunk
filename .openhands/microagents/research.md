# Research Guide

This guide covers web searches as research to support your development efforts.

Use research to augment your knowledge of tools and libraries and to find inspiration for different ways to solve a problem.

## Executing web searches

When you decide to perform research, try to issue a limited number of highly divergent and contrastive search queries.

There's no use in multiple searches with slight variations in wording. Make sure you search for very different terms when you
perform research.
