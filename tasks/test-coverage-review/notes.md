# Task: Test Coverage Review

## Understanding
Review the test file `test_serialization.py` to ensure:
1. Tests properly cover the serialization changes
2. Assertions truly validate the code's intention
3. No conditional logic that could allow tests to pass incorrectly
4. Edge cases are covered
5. Round-trip serialization is properly tested

## Progress Log
