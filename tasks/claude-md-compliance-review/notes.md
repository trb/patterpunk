# Task: CLAUDE.md Compliance Review

## Understanding
Review all changes in the `serialization` branch (compared to `main`) for compliance with all CLAUDE.md file rules and guidance. This includes code design rules, architecture principles, and project-specific conventions.

## Key CLAUDE.md Rules to Check
- Working memory limit: max 4 chunks per scope
- Early returns over nested conditionals
- Composition over inheritance
- Pure functions where possible
- No orphan code
- Intent-revealing names
- Self-documenting code

## Progress Log
- Starting headless Claude Code reviewer

## Status
IN_PROGRESS
